It depends on your use case, but one way to do it is to use FadeInImage which has a property of img for the image that is intended to load, and placeholder, well, for the placeholder

FadeInImage(image: NetworkImage(url), placeholder: AssetImage(assetName)
You can also listen until the image is loaded and show a placeholder yourself until fetching the image resolves.

pseudo code

bool _loaded = false;
var img = Image.network(src);
var placeholder = AssetImage(assetName)

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  img.image.resolve(ImageConfiguration()).addListener((i, b) {
    if (mounted) {
      setState(() => _loaded = true);
    }
  });
}

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return YourWidget(
    child: _loaded ? img : placeholder,
  );
}
